Key aspects of the course include:\n\n1. **Course Description**: Students learn to specify problems clearly, design systematically, and reason rigorously. The course is built around two core models of computation: the functional model and the imperative model【8:0†source】.\n\n2. **Learning Objectives**:\n   - Specification and correctness of computational problems.\n   - Algorithmic thinking and systematic problem-solving.\n   - Reading, writing, and reasoning about code.\n   - Understanding different computational models【8:1†source】.\n\n3. **Prerequisites**: A background in mathematics, specifically MAT-1000 or equivalent, is required【8:1†source】.\n\n4. **Grading**: The course uses a feedback-oriented assessment approach instead of traditional point values. It consists of in-class assessments, take-home assignments, and a final exam【8:1†source】.\n\nIf you have any specific questions about the course or its content, feel free to ask!","model":"asst_iMrJ9MMILN2oYC5wYO7rBDkm","responseTime":9549,"promptLength":45,"responseLength":1078}
