They discussed how Big O notation is used to describe the upper bound of an algorithm's growth rate as the input size increases. Key concepts included common time complexities like O(1), O(log n), O(n), O(n log n), and O(n^2), and how to determine the Big O complexity of simple algorithms.\n\nWas there anything specific about the lecture that you were curious about?\n","model":"gemini","responseTime":3446,"promptLength":28,"responseLength":465}
