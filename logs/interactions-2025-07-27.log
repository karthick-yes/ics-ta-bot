This course appears to be an introduction to computer science (CS-1102). It includes lectures, in-class assessments every Friday, and take-home assignments. The grading emphasizes understanding and growth over optimizing for grades, with detailed feedback provided on assessments.\nIs there anything specific you'd like to know about the course?\n","model":"gemini","responseTime":4549,"promptLength":39,"responseLength":356}

Think of it as a function calling itself to solve a smaller part of the problem until it reaches a base case, which it can solve directly.\n\nHere's an analogy: Imagine you have a set of Russian nesting dolls. Each doll contains a smaller doll inside it. To open all the dolls, you would open the first doll, then open the doll inside it, and so on, until you reach the smallest doll that you can't open further. This is similar to how recursion works.\n\nHere's a simple example in code (Python):\n\n```python\ndef factorial(n):\n    if n == 0:  # Base case\n        return 1\n    else:\n        return n * factorial(n-1)  # Recursive call\n```\n\nIn this example:\n\n1.  The `factorial` function calls itself with a smaller input (`n-1`).\n2.  The base case is when `n` is 0, which returns 1.\n\nDoes this initial explanation help clarify what recursion is?\n","model":"gemini","responseTime":5543,"promptLength":38,"responseLength":1010}
