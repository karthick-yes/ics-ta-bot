I can answer questions about concepts, help you understand problem statements, offer debugging tips, and guide you through proofs.\n\nBefore we dive in, what are *you* working on right now? Is there a specific topic or assignment you'd like to discuss?\n","model":"gemini","responseTime":4845,"promptLength":32,"responseLength":303}

Based on the course materials, it looks like recursion is covered in Module 1 (\"A Functional Model of Computation\") and touched on again in Module 2 (\"Iteration is Tail Recursion\").\n\nTo check my understanding, are you asking about recursion in the context of functional programming (like in OCaml or Haskell), or more generally? Also, what specifically are you curious about? For example, are you wondering how it works, why it's useful, or how it relates to iteration?\n","model":"gemini","responseTime":4449,"promptLength":61,"responseLength":476}
